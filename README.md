# Lyrics::Cli

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/lyrics/cli`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lyrics-cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lyrics-cli

## Usage

After you have installed your bundles and start to run the program, the Cli will wake up and welcome you.
When prompted to do so, enter the name of the artist and the name of the song that you would like to find.
After your lyrics are displayed you will be asked if you would like to do an another search.
If you choose not to do another search you will be asked if you would like to get a list of the artist or song names that you have searched up to that point.
If you choose artist you will receive a list of all artist that you have search and if you choose songs you will get a list of the song names that you have searched.
After you have get the list of your choice the Cli will say its goodbyes to you and end.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
